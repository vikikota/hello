          Vikt√≥ria was one of the main engines of the self-organization of the Scrum team. After a few weeks, she
          proactively initiated and ensured the backlog refinement, generated valuable discussions, and politely raised
          conflictual points. Besides these, the team could always be sure that Viki would deliver high-quality work. As
          a Scrum Master, it was a pleasure for me to work together.
